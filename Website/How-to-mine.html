            Assuming you're interested in trying out cryptocurrency mining, there's a lot of conflicting advice on how
            to go about tuning for optimal performance. Many tutorials throw caution to the wind and look to maximise
            hash rates, with little heed to the differences in individual graphics cards. It's a fast track to dead
            hardware if you're not careful. While it's true that AMD and vidia graphics cards tend to be tuned somewhat
            conservatively, the intent is for the card to handle hours of gaming, every day, for several years. 24/7
            cryptocurrency mining is a completely different use case.
            There's a reason Nvidia's data center GPUs are usually clocked lower than consumer GeForce parts, with very
            different cooling configurations. Supercomputers use high-speed fans that push a lot of air through the
            coolers, and the fans are designed to be hot-swappable. The cards are designed for 24/7 high utilisation,
            which means thermal pads and other elements are also built to those specifications. Even someone playing
            games eight hours a day, every day, won't come close to punishing a card like mining will. Keep that in mind
            Also remember that what works well on one GPU, or even one particular card using a specific GPU, may not
            work evervwhere
            The silicon lottery is real, parts are binned and tested to meet certain criteria, and some have more
            headroom than others.
            Redlining a graphics card to improve hash rates might result in short-term gains, but it's also a quick way
            to burn out fans, VRMs, memory chips, or even the GPU. Start slow, check how your card is doing on
            temperatures and fan speeds, and don't worry about chasing down every last hash.
            To check vour temperatures and fan speeds, we recommend using HWInfo64 (image right). The latest version
            shows maximum GDDR6X temps on the RTX 3080 and 3090, as well as GDDR6 temperatures on most AMD RX 5000 and
            RX 6000 cards (so far, GDDR6 thermals on RTX 20-series and lower tier RTX
            30-series GPs aren't available). The specific card and fan design play a role, and consumer graphics card
            fans are not designed to run at a constant 80-100 percent fan speed, all day, every day. Many cards actually
            limit the maximum fan speed to around 50 percent, and won't go above that unless things get really bad -
            like super-hot GDDR6X temperatures. Consumer cards also tend to prioritise lower noise levels and higher
            temperatures, which is counterproductive to 24/7 mining.
            If you want a reasonable estimate of where a card should run its fans, turn off any overclock and launch a
            demanding game such as Metro Exodus at 1440p ultra settings, and just let it run for 15-20 minutes, then
            check temperatures, fan speeds, clocks, and so on. The maximum fan speed you see is what the manufacturer
            thinks should allow the card to last three-plus Years. Go anywhere above that and you're more likely to have
            fans or other components fail.
            For temperatures, lower is better, at least up to a point (a.
            not freezing). For long-term mining, we'd try to keep GPU
            temperatures below 70 C, but that may not even be the critical
            factor Keeping VRM (Voltage Regulator Modulas) temperatures
            below 85 C is also desirable, and we definitely wouldn't run with
            memory temperatures over 100 C and expect a card to remain
            viable. The RTX 3080 and 3090 are the worst culprits, with
            GDDR6X often settling in at 106-110 C, but better cards - or
            ones where you've replaced the default thermal pads with
            something better can keep GDDREX mining temperatures
            under 90 C.
            Depending on your GPU, tuning performance can often
            dramatically cut power requirements without impacting hash
            rates, and lower power generally means lower temperatures as
            well Ethereum mining prefers memory bandwidth over raw
            computational power, so turning down GPU clocks and power
            limits while overclocking the memory usually leads to better
            performance. Undervolting the GPU core can also help reduce
            power and heat, particularly on certain AMD GPUs. Search the
            web for details on your specific GPU, but again be conservative.
            and don't jump straight to maximum performance settings. If
            your particular card ends up 10-15 percent slower on hash
            rates than you see others reporting, but your temperatures and
            power use are lower, the card will likely last longer.
