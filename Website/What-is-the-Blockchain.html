            The starting point for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the blockchain. It's become a buzzword, but the
            short description is pretty drab. The blockchain contains an open ledger of all transactions that have ever
            taken place on a given cryptocurrency network. Did you send money to Uncle Theo, paying him for a graphics
            card? It's in the blockchain, for everyone to see. So, when your friend comes by claiming you never paid him
            back for the concert tickets, or the fast-food stop, or whatever, you can find incontrovertible proof - one
            way or the other. That might sound interesting, but it probably sounds alarming, too. Why would you want
            everyone to be able to check on what amounts to your digital bank account? That's where the second part of
            the blockchain comes into play: All transactions are at least somewhat anonymous. Unless you publicly list
            your Bitcoin wallet address - and it's trivial to create more addresses, so you can have more than one -
            determining what money belongs to whom is difficult. It's not impossible, especially with enough time,
            effort, and use of a specific wallet, but there are ways to obfuscate your transactions and keep them veiled
            from prying eyes. The more important aspect of the blockchain isn't just that it keeps a record of all
            transactions. The critical factor is that it's backed by strong cryptography - SHA256, in the case of
            Bitcoin, and dozens of other cryptographic algorithms for other coins. A lot of complex math goes into the
            creation of a good cryptographic algorithm, with the end goal being that the only way to crack it would be
            brute force. SHA256 has a 256-bit cypher length, so breaking the encryption for a single message would
            involve finding the one number out of a 2256 number space that's correct. If that doesn't seem like a big
            deal, let's put it differently: 2256 is the same as 1.158×1077, or in other words, it's a 1 followed by 77
            zeroes. Our solar system has roughly 1.2X1056 atoms, the Milky Way galaxy has approximately 2.4×1067 atoms,
            and depending on whose math you want to use, the entire universe has anywhere from 1078-1082 atoms. That
            means a 256-bit number space is large enough that you can easily assign a unique number to every atom in the
            galaxy, with room to spare. We're simplifying quite a bit, but the main point is that cracking the
            cryptography behind Bitcoin would be extremely difficult, and other coins use even stronger cryptography.
            Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies also use cryptography for the unique user wallet addresses. In the case
            of Bitcoin, there are currently a potential 2160 addresses, or around a quindecillion. No, we didn't just
            make that word up. That's a one with 48 zeroes after it. Or if you prefer, it's 1 trillion × 1 trillion × 1
            trillion × 1 trillion. We're not likely to run out of wallet addresses anytime soon. All of this
            cryptography plays a pivotal role in cryptocurrencies, as you might guess considering the name. They're
            "currencies" - perhaps digital commodities would be a better name, but that ship has sailed - backed by
            cryptography. And when we say cryptography, what we mean is complex math, the sort of thing to make even
            your calculus teacher squinch up their face. So-called "fiat" currencies, such as the US dollar, are backed
            by trust in the government and banking institutions. Bitcoin and Ethereum are backed by our trust in math.
            Actually, they're backed by math plus all of the people willing to participate in securing the
            cryptocurrency network, which brings us to the next topic.

            We've talked about cryptography, but what exactly makes this whole blockchain thing secure? Cryptocurrencies
            run as a large distributed network of computing resources, with the various nodes communicating with each
            other. Every time someone wants to move coins - or really, a portion of a coin, with most cryptocurrencies
            able to deal with amounts to eight decimal places - they send a transaction out on to the network and it
            becomes available for inclusion in the next block. Each block encapsulates all of the transactions since the
            previous block into one chunk, creates a digital hash signature of the block, and the entire thing gets
            submitted as a new addition to the blockchain.
            Here's where things get interesting. You can't just add a new block to the network any time you want. That
            block needs to satisfv certain requirements. In short, you need to find a solution to a mathematical
            function defined by the coin algorithm.
            The function uses the results of the previous block as input, going back in a chain to the original genesis
            block. This means no one can get a head start by trying to solve for future blocks until the current block
            has been "solved." The algorithms are also designed such that the solutions are effectively random, selected
            from the entire number space for the cryptography key. There can be a huge number of acceptable solutions,
            and your hardware just needs to find one of these.
            When a system does find a solution, it gets to pick which transactions get included in that block (ideally,
            all of them, but more on that in a moment), wraps them all up with a tidy bow, calculates a digital
            signature, and submits that to the network. Other nodes on the network can then verify the solution and
            accept or reject it. Each potential solution has a timestamp, and the network has various criteria to help
            determine which block was found first. Eventually, the network reaches a consensus among enough nodes
